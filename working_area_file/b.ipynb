Given the considerable global burden of T2DM, innovative \\ntherapeutic approaches to improve patient outcomes remain a public health \\npriority. This review first provides an in-depth analysis of the current state \\nof therapy, from novel pharmacotherapy to lifestyle interventions and new \\ntreatment methods. At the same time, the rapidly increasing role of AI in \\ndiabetes care is woven into the story, mainly targeting how insulin therapy can \\nbe modified and personalized through algorithms and predictive modelling. It \\nleaves a deep review of their pre-existing synergies, which helps understand how \\ncollaborative opportunities will unlock the future of T2DM care. This critical \\nrole is shown by integrating recent therapeutic advances and AI with overall \\nshowcasing better screening, diagnosis, and therapeutics decision-making to \\noutcome prediction in T2DM. The review emphasizes how AI applications in insulin \\ntherapy have transformative potential in diabetes care. These person-centred \\napproaches to T2DM management, which are more effective and personalized than \\nsome traditional strategies, only work because of the often-hidden synergies \\nbetween AI algorithms in areas such as diagnostic criteria, predictive methods, \\nand familiar classification tools for subgroups with relevant aspects/predictors \\non prognosis or treatment responsiveness.\\n\\n© 2025 The Author(s).\\n\\nDOI: 10.1016/j.jpha.2025.101305\\nPMCID: PMC12268056\\nPMID: 40678477\\n\\nConflict of interest statement: The authors declare that there are no conflicts \\nof interest.

Drug resistance can \\ndevelop with any therapeutic agent, and metformin is no exception. As we showed \\nin our previous study, metformin-resistant MDA-MB-468 (MET-R) cells exhibited an \\nEMT-like phenotype. Many transcription factors, as well as miRNAs, can \\ncontribute to this altered phenotype. Our current study identifies the \\ncontribution of hsa-miR-26a-5p expression to the previously observed phenotype.\\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: By utilizing bioinformatic tools, we identified \\nhsa-miR-26a-5p, whose expression was significantly altered with increasing \\nconcentrations of metformin in MET-R cells. We rescued hsa-miR-26a-5p expression \\nand examined the EMT phenotype and apoptotic markers via Western blot analysis.\\nRESULTS: We observed a reduction in hsa-miR-26a-5p expression in response to \\nincreasing concentrations of metformin in MET-R cells. Upon successful \\nrestoration of hsa-miR-26a-5p expression, a subsequent decrease in the \\nproliferation rate was noted. Moreover, when combined with a PI3K inhibitor, we \\nobserved increased sensitivity to the PI3K inhibitor. The EMT and apoptotic \\nmarkers also tended to decrease upon combinatorial treatment.\\nCONCLUSION: In this study, we rescued the diminished expression of \\nhsa-miR-26a-5p in MET-R cells to increase the sensitivity to PI3K inhibitor. The \\ncombination of a PI3K inhibitor and rescued hsa-miR-26-5p expression resulted in \\nthe restoration of the EMT phenotype and proliferation in these cells.\\n\\n© TÜBİTAK.\\n\\nDOI: 10.55730/1300-0152.2749\\nPMCID: PMC12266353\\nPMID: 40678416\\n\\nConflict of interest statement: Conflict of interest: The authors declare no \\nconflict of interest.'},\n",

In addition to an increased \\nlikelihood of developing T2DM, individuals with prediabetes have an elevated \\nrisk of various vascular and non-vascular complications. No consensus has been \\nachieved on the ideal screening strategy for prediabetes, with fasting plasma \\nglucose concentration, glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) and the oral glucose \\ntolerance test being the most frequently measured parameters. The two major \\nphenotypes of prediabetes, that is, impaired fasting glucose and impaired \\nglucose tolerance, may represent different pathophysiologies with varying \\nnatural history, risk of adverse outcomes and responsiveness to treatment. Most \\nof the evidence for managing prediabetes focuses on lifestyle modification with \\nor without medications in individuals with overweight or obesity and impaired \\nglucose tolerance. Whether these interventions are beneficial in individuals \\nwith impaired fasting glucose and those of normal body weight is unclear, as is \\nthe cost-effectiveness and sustainability of pharmacotherapy for treating \\nprediabetes.

Conventional treatments, including insulin therapy \\nand oral hypoglycemic agents, often fail to restore normal glucose homeostasis \\nand may cause side effects. Mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) therapy has emerged as a \\npromising alternative, leveraging the regenerative and immunomodulatory \\nproperties of stem cells to address the underlying pathophysiology of diabetes. \\nGiven the increasing prevalence of diabetes and limitations of conventional \\ntherapies, evaluating novel regenerative interventions such as MSC therapy is \\nboth timely and clinically imperative.\\nOBJECTIVE: This umbrella review synthesizes evidence from systematic reviews and \\nmeta-analyses to evaluate the efficacy and safety of MSC therapy for diabetes, \\nfocusing on clinical outcomes, mechanisms of action, and potential to overcome \\nlimitations of current treatments.\\nMETHODS: A comprehensive literature search was conducted across PubMed/MEDLINE, \\nScopus, and Web of Science up to July 30, 2025, following PRISMA guidelines. \\nInclusion criteria encompassed systematic reviews and meta-analyses assessing \\nMSC therapy in type 1 (T1DM) or type 2 diabetes (T2DM) patients, with outcomes \\nsuch as glycemic control, beta-cell function, and safety. Methodological quality \\nwas assessed using the AMSTAR-2 tool. Data were analyzed for study overlap, \\nclinical outcomes, and safety profiles.\\nRESULTS: The review included 17 systematic reviews and meta-analyses \\nrepresenting over 8000 patients. MSC therapy demonstrated significant \\nimprovements in glycemic control, particularly in T2DM, with reductions in HbA1c \\n(up to 1.45\\u202f%) and insulin requirements (up to 2.05 U/kg/day). In T1DM, MSC \\ntherapy improved C-peptide levels and HbA1c but showed variable effects on \\ninsulin dependence. Wharton's jelly-derived MSCs and bone marrow-derived cells \\nexhibited superior efficacy, while umbilical cord blood-derived MSCs were less \\neffective. Adverse events were generally mild (e.g., fever, injection-site \\nreactions), with severe events rare and linked to combination therapies.\\nCONCLUSION: MSC therapy holds significant promise for diabetes management, \\nespecially for T2DM, with favorable safety profiles. However, heterogeneity in \\nstudy designs and limited long-term data highlight the need for standardized \\nprotocols and large-scale randomized trials. Future research should focus on \\noptimizing MSC sources, delivery methods, and long-term outcomes to facilitate \\nclinical translation.\\n\\nCopyright © 2025 Elsevier Ltd.

However, the pattern of multimorbidity, including typical \\ncomplications, remains unclear. This study aims to explore the current status \\nand influencing factors of multimorbidity in T2DM, with a focus on mining \\nfrequent disease combination patterns and strong association rules. Data on 26 \\ndiseases were extracted from the electronic medical records of 5,838 \\nhospitalized patients with type 2 diabetes. The chi-square test, \\nCochran-Armitage trend test, and logistic regression were used for the analysis \\nof influential factors. Association rule mining was employed to explore frequent \\ndisease combinations and association rules across the entire population and \\nsubgroups stratified by gender, age, and BMI. Network graphs were used to \\nvisualize binary comorbidity relationships. Gender-specific differences in \\ndisease prevalence were found for 18 of the 26 diseases included in this study. \\nThe prevalence of multimorbidity was 97.8%, and it increased with age, with a \\nhigher prevalence in males (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05). The identified frequent disease \\ncombination patterns mainly centered around typical complications of T2DM. The \\nmost frequent binary comorbidity pattern was diabetic peripheral neuropathy \\n(DPN)\\u2009+\\u2009diabetic peripheral vascular disease (DPVD) (support: 74.1%), which is a \\nnovel finding in the relationship between DPN and DPVD. The primary association \\nrule identified was {DPVD\\u2009+\\u2009diabetic nephropathy (DN)}→{Hypertension}. Disease \\ncombination patterns and association rules varied across gender, age, and BMI. \\nComorbidity relationships became more complex in the middle and older age \\ngroups, as well as in the overweight and obese groups. The findings of this \\nstudy can be used to guide clinicians in the prevention and treatment of \\nmultimorbidity in T2DM and provide possible directions for researchers to \\nfurther investigate the causes and mechanisms.\\n\\n© 2025.

Understanding epidemiologic trends in the modifiable risk factors \\ndriving CVDs is essential in designing effective countermeasures.\\nOBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to forecast geospatial trends of \\nmodifiable cardiovascular risk factors, namely high systolic blood pressure \\n(SBP), high fasting plasma glucose, high body mass index (BMI), high low-density \\nlipoprotein cholesterol, and tobacco use from 2025 to 2050.\\nMETHODS: Historical data on disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) and mortality \\nfrom the GBD (Global Burden of Disease) 2021 study were used to forecast the \\nburden associated with modifiable cardiovascular risk factors from 2025 to 2050. \\nTrends across GBD super-regions, sex, sociodemographic index, and age groups \\nwere examined.\\nRESULTS: In 2050, high SBP (1,694.2 [95% uncertainty interval [UI]: \\n1,454.6-1,933.9] per 100,000 population) will contribute to the highest \\nage-standardized DALYs, followed by high low-density lipoprotein cholesterol \\n(657.6 [95% UI: 511.9-803.3] per 100,000 population), high BMI (495.2 [95% UI: \\n330.8-659.6] per 100,000 population), tobacco use (493.7 [95% UI: 378.2-609.1] \\nper 100,000 population), and high fasting plasma glucose (466.7 [95% UI: \\n311.9-621.5] per 100,000 population). Although age-standardized DALY rates will \\nfall across all cardiovascular risk factors from 2025 to 2050, overall crude \\nDALYs associated with cardiovascular risk factors are projected to rise within \\nthe same period. High SBP (rising by 99 million DALYs; 44.1% increase), and high \\nBMI (increasing by 44 million DALYs; 88.0% increase) will have the greatest rise \\nin crude DALYs from 2025 to 2050.\\nCONCLUSIONS: Although the projected decline in age-standardized DALYs of \\nmodifiable cardiovascular risk factors suggest improved management of CVDs, \\ncrude DALYs will continue to rise due to population growth and aging.\\n\\nCopyright © 2025 The Authors.

Therefore, this systematic review \\nemphasizes the clinical therapeutic implications of non-insulin anti-diabetic \\nmedications for diabetic microvascular complications.\\nMETHODS: We retrieved published literature reporting randomized clinical trials \\n(RCTs) on the effects of microvascular complications, including diabetic \\nnephropathy (DN), diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN), and diabetic retinopathy \\n(DR), from authenticated clinical databases: PubMed, Excerpta Medica database \\n(EMBASE), and Web of Science. We synthesized data, including the continuous \\nvariable indices: estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), urinary albumin \\nto creatinine ratio (UACR), and urinary albumin excretion rate (UAE). Indices \\nmeasuring cardiovascular autonomic neuropathy (CAN), vibration detection \\nthreshold (VDT), and retinal nerve fiber thickness (RNFL) were used to calculate \\nmicrovascular effects. We also synthesized dichotomous variable indices, \\nincluding the risks for DR and DPN.\\nRESULTS: According to our analyses, there was sparse evidence strongly \\nsupporting that metformin (MET), Sulfonylurea (SUs), Repaglinide (Repa), or \\nα-Glucosidase inhibitors (α-GIs) could benefit diabetic microvascular \\ncomplications when adopted as monotherapy. Regardless of the no change in eGFR, \\ntwo trials reporting Thiazolidinediones (TZDs) significantly reduced the UACR, \\nwhile other clinical trials reported an increase in VDT and improvement in DR. \\nSodium glucose co-transporter inhibitors (SGLT-2i) and Glucagon-like peptide-1 \\nreceptor agonists (GLP-1RA) both showed protective effects in preventing eGFR \\ndecline, with only SGLT-2i demonstrating a significant reduction in UACR. A \\nrecent trial showed that Dipeptidyl Peptidase IV inhibitors (DPP-IVi) may \\npotentially reduce the risk of DPN, while GLP-1RA did not prove to alter the \\nmeasures of CAN and DPN. However, the SUSTAIN 6 trial revealed that Semaglutide \\nmay increase the risk of DR.\\nCONCLUSION: Besides their anti-hyperglycemic properties, some currently reviewed \\nmedications may exhibit unique anti-microvascular abilities. Due to ambiguous \\nand conflicting available results, more emerging or ongoing trials will address \\nthis issue and could benefit clinical strategies for personalized treatment \\npractices.\\nCLINICAL TRIAL NUMBER: Not applicable.\\n\\n© 2025.

Recent research shows that both diseases \\nshare complex and related pathophysiological processes. Network medicine \\napproaches can help to elucidate common dysregulated processes among different \\ndiseases, such as AD and T2D. Thus, the aim of this work was to determine \\ndifferentially expressed genes (DEGs) in AD and T2D and to apply a network \\nmedicine approach to identify the microRNAs (miRNAs) involved in the AD-T2D \\nassociation.\\nMETHODS: Gene expression microarray data sets consisting of 384 control samples \\nand 399 samples belonging to AD and T2D disease were analyzed to obtain DEGs \\nshared by both diseases; the miRNAs associated with these DEGs were predicted \\nusing a network medicine approach. Finally, potential small molecules targeting \\nthese potentially deregulated miRNAs were identified.\\nRESULTS: AD and T2D shared a small subset of 82 downregulated DEGs. These genes \\nwere significantly associated (p < 0.01) with the ontology terms of chemical \\nsynaptic deregulation. DEGs were associated with 12 miRNAs expressed in specific \\ntissues for AD and T2D. Such miRNAs were also primarily associated with the \\nontology terms related to synaptic deregulation and cancer, and AKT signaling \\npathways. Steroid anti-inflammatory drugs, antineoplastics, and glucose \\nmetabolites were predicted to be potential regulators of the 12 shared miRNAs.\\nDISCUSSION: The network medicine approach integrating DEGs and miRNAs enabled \\nthe identification of shared, potentially deregulated biological processes and \\npathways underlying the pathophysiology of AD and T2D. These common molecular \\nmechanisms were also linked to drugs currently used in clinical practice, \\nsuggesting that this strategy may inform future drug repurposing efforts. \\nNonetheless, further in-depth biological validation is required to confirm these \\nfindings.\\nCONCLUSION: Network medicine allowed identifying 12 miRNAs involved in the \\nAD-T2D association, and these could be drug targets for the design of new \\ntreatments; however, the identified miRNAs need further experimental \\nconfirmation.\\n\\nCopyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at \\nepub@benthamscience.net.\\n\\nDOI: 10.2174/0115672050393875250626065205\\nPMID: 40662549\"}]"

CD8-positive cells were predominantly \\nlocated in the tumor stroma, with a positive rate of 56.38% (265/470). Moreover, \\nthe positive expression intensity in the high TIL level group was significantly \\nhigher than in the low TIL level group (high TIL group: 78.9%, low TIL group: \\n35.4%, P < 0.05). The statistical results indicated that 37.45% (176/470) of \\ncases exhibited no or low TIL levels, 42.34% (199/470) showed moderate TIL \\nlevels, and 20.21% (95/470) presented high TIL levels. TIL levels were \\nsignificantly associated with histological grade of BC (percentage of high-grade \\ncases in the high TIL group: 65.3%, in the low TIL group: 22.1%, P < 0.05), \\nKi-67 index (high TIL group: 45.2% ± 12.3%, low TIL group: 25.6% ± 10.8%, P < \\n0.05), vascular tumor embolism (VTE) (VTE-positive rate in the high TIL group: \\n38.9%, in the low TIL group: 12.4%, P < 0.05), lymph node metastasis (LNM) \\n(LNM-positive rate in the high TIL group: 52.6%, in the low TIL group: 28.4%, P \\n< 0.05), and estrogen receptor (ER) expression (ER-negative rate in the high TIL \\ngroup: 68.4%, in the low TIL group: 32.1%, P < 0.05). Spearman correlation \\nanalysis revealed a positive correlation between TILs and HER-2 (r = 0.149, P = \\n0.002), as well as CD8 (r = 0.593, P = 0.001). Analysis of the GEPIA database \\nshowed that patients with high HER-2 expression had significantly lower \\ndisease-free survival (DFS) compared to those with low expression (hazard ratio \\n[HR] = 1.45, P = 0.003), while patients with high CD8 expression exhibited \\nsignificantly higher DFS than those with low expression (HR = 0.72, P = 0.001). \\nIn HER-2-positive BC patients, TIL levels were positively correlated with HER-2 \\nand CD8 expression (high HER-2 expression group: TIL high expression rate 48.6%, \\nlow HER-2 expression group: TIL high expression rate 15.2%, P < 0.05). TIL \\nlevels in HER-2-positive BC patients were positively correlated with both HER-2 \\nand CD8 expression. TIL levels were closely related to the prognosis of BC \\npatients, which may provide a theoretical basis for precision treatment in BC.\\n\\n© 2025 the author(s), published by De Gruyter.\\n\\nDOI: 10.1515/biol-2025-1113\\nPMCID: PMC12269946\\nPMID: 40678390\\n\\nConflict of interest statement: Conflict of interest: Authors state no conflict \\nof interest.'}\n",

In 30% of cases the VTE is unprovoked, with a risk of recurrence and \\ntherefore of mortality that is higher in these patients. The duration of \\nanticoagulation is still a matter of debate: standard or short-term (3-6 months) \\nversus extended (no end date).\\nOBJECTIVES: To analyze the potential benefit of prolonged anticoagulation on \\noverall mortality, according to type and duration of treatments.\\nMETHODS: PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane were searched to identify randomized \\ncontrolled trials. They had to be designed to compare 2 anticoagulation \\nstrategies in patients with unprovoked VTE: short versus extended. No date \\nrestrictions were applied the search was last updated on September 30, 2023.\\nRESULTS: Sixteen articles were included in the meta-analysis. Four studies \\nevaluated full dose of direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs), one of them also \\nconsidered the half dose of DOACs. One study used idraparinux and the others \\nused vitamin K antagonists. The overall risk of bias in individual studies was \\nconsidered low using the Rob 2 tool. Overall deaths occurred in 88 patients \\n(1.51%) in the extended treatment group and 99 patients (1.88%) in the \\nshort-term group. Extended anticoagulation therapy does not significantly reduce \\ntotal mortality (relative risk [RR]: 0.81 [95% CI: 0.61-1.08]). Subgroup \\nanalysis showed a significant reduction of deaths in the extended treatment \\ngroup with DOACs (RR: 0.49 [95% CI: 0.28-0.86]), but the absolute risk of death \\nwas low (<1% in the short-term DOACs subgroup).\\nCONCLUSION: Extended anticoagulation has no benefit on overall mortality \\ncompared with short-term treatment. However, subgroup analysis shows a benefit \\nof DOACs that reduces overall mortality, contrary to vitamin K antagonists..\\n\\n© 2025 The Authors.\\n\\nDOI: 10.1016/j.rpth.2025.102928\\nPMCID: PMC12269505\\nPMID: 40678356'}\n",

Systemic inflammation and shared risk factors \\ncontribute to the development of these comorbidities. Additionally, Preserved \\nRatio Impaired Spirometry (PRISm) has been recognized as a high-risk condition \\nfor COPD progression; however, its comorbid burden remains insufficiently \\nstudied. This review summarizes key findings from clinically relevant studies \\npublished in 2024, focusing on cardiovascular diseases (CVD), pulmonary \\nconditions, frailty, and obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) in both COPD and PRISm. \\nCVD risk in COPD varies according to disease phenotype, with exacerbation \\nseverity and frequency serving as independent risk factors for myocardial \\ninfarction and pulmonary embolism. Bronchiectasis affects up to 69% of COPD \\npatients, leading to higher exacerbation rates and mortality. The recently \\nproposed ROSE criteria (Radiological bronchiectasis, Obstruction, Symptoms, and \\nExposure) provide an objective framework for characterizing patients with both \\nbronchiectasis and COPD. This classification has shown that patients meeting the \\nROSE criteria are at increased risk of COPD exacerbations and hospitalization \\ndue to exacerbation. Furthermore, recent studies demonstrate a strong \\nassociation between severe OSA and PRISm, with a significantly higher prevalence \\nin severe OSA cases (12.9%) compared to mild/moderate OSA (6.2%). PRISm and COPD \\nare also linked to accelerated frailty progression, emphasizing the need for \\nearly identification and management of comorbidities. These findings highlight \\nthe importance of a multidimensional approach to COPD and PRISm, incorporating \\nobjective diagnostic criteria and early interventions.

This study aimed to explore whether \\nprestroke glycemic control is linked to plaque instability and could result in \\nvarying types and mechanisms of stroke.\\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively included 107 patients with infarction \\nattributed to atherosclerotic stenosis of the M1 segment of the MCA within \\n4\\u2009weeks of symptom onset, all of whom underwent high-resolution MR imaging. \\nPatients were categorized into 4 groups based on their history of diabetes \\nmellitus (DM) and their prestroke glycemic control: non-diabetes mellitus, \\nglycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) <7.0%, HbA1c 7.0-8.9%, and HbA1c\\u2009≥\\u20099.0%. The \\nmorphology and composition of intracranial atherosclerotic plaques were \\nevaluated by HR-MRI. The degree of plaque enhancement was measured by the \\nplaque-to-pituitary stalk contrast ratio based on signal intensity values on \\npostcontrast T1 images. The infarct pattern and stroke mechanisms were analyzed \\nthrough diffusion-weighted imaging.\\nRESULTS: Among the enrolled 107 patients with stroke, 49 (45.79%) had DM. The \\nremodeling index, wall index, and the degree of stenosis did not differ between \\nthe 4 groups. Poor glycemic control was associated with a higher prevalence of \\nlarge cortical/cortical-deep patterns (25.9% in non-DM, 35.7% in HbA1c <7.0%, \\n39.1% in HbA1c 7.0-8.9%, and 41.7% in HbA1c\\u2009≥\\u20099.0% group). Compared with non-DM \\ngroup, the proportion of artery-to-artery embolism and mixed mechanisms tends to \\nincrease along with increased HbA1c levels. The higher prevalence of intraplaque \\nhemorrhage (40.8% versus 19.0%, P = .01), discontinuity of plaque surface (34.7% \\nversus 12.7%, P = .01), and complicated plaque (defined as plaques with surface \\ndefects or hemorrhage) (55.1% versus 22.4%, P < .001) was significantly observed \\nin diabetic patients more so than non-DM patients. HbA1c\\u2009≥\\u20099.0% was \\nindependently associated with an increased degree of plaque enhancement \\n(coefficient: 0.35, P < .001).\\nCONCLUSIONS: Poor glycemic control is independently linked to heightened plaque \\nenhancement and a higher prevalence of complicated plaque. More large \\ncortical/cortical-deep patterns were found, which may be associated with a small \\nincrease in artery-to-artery embolism and mixed mechanisms in such patients.\\n\\n© 2025 by American Journal of Neuroradiology.\\n\\nDOI: 10.3174/ajnr.A8721\\nPMID: 40675810\"}\n",

We performed \\nemergency EVAR, and an open abdomen and temporary abdominal closure technique. \\nOn post-operative day 5, he experienced sudden cardiac arrest due to PE caused \\nby DVT. An emergency pulmonary artery thrombectomy was performed. The abdomen \\nwas opened again and the retroperitoneal hematoma was removed. The postoperative \\ncourse was uneventful and the patient was discharged without sequelae.\\nCLINICAL DISCUSSION: The thrombus formation was considered to have been caused \\nby an aneurysm and a retroperitoneal hematoma that compressed the inferior vena \\ncava.\\nCONCLUSION: If a ruptured AAA protrudes toward the right side and is associated \\nwith a large right-sided hematoma, clinicians might have to consider removing \\nthe hematoma simultaneously via EVAR.\\n\\nCopyright © 2025 The Authors.

Multivariable regressions \\nwere performed for COVID-19-specific hospitalization and mortality (proportional \\nhazard and cause-specific hazard models).\\nRESULTS: Of 1572 eligible adult patients (median [range] age, 60 [18-93] years; \\n840 female [53.4%]), 1066 (67.8%) had a solid tumor, with 683 (64.0%) having \\nmetastatic disease; breast (252 [23.6%]) and lung cancer (148 [13.9%]) were most \\ncommon. At enrollment, 1013 patients (64.4%) were unvaccinated for SARS-CoV-2. \\nCOVID-19-related mortality at 90 days was 3.0% and did not increase at \\nsubsequent time points. The cumulative incidence of COVID-19-specific death in \\nthe first 90 days was highest in patients with lymphoma, intermediate in \\npatients with acute leukemia and lung cancer, and lowest in patients with other \\nsolid tumors and other hematologic cancers. In multivariable analysis, receipt \\nof chemotherapy (hazard ratio [HR], 1.97; 95% CI, 1.52-2.54) and baseline \\nhistory of stroke, atrial fibrillation, or pulmonary embolism (HR, 1.78; 95% CI, \\n1.33-2.38) were associated with a higher risk of hospitalization. Vaccination \\nprior to SARS-CoV-2 infection was associated with a lower risk of \\nhospitalization (HR, 0.52; 95% CI, 0.38-0.70). Over 2 years of follow-up, there \\nwere 1739 cancer treatment disruptions, of which 881 (50.7%) were attributed to \\nCOVID-19, with most disruptions occurring within the first 30 days.\\nCONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The results of this prospective cohort study showed \\nthat COVID-19 had a significant impact on patients with cancer, including \\nhospitalization, treatment disruptions, and death.\\n\\nDOI: 10.1001/jamaoncol.2025.2010\\nPMID: 40674082'}\n",

Chronic myeloid leukemia \\n(CML), particularly when associated with hyperleukocytosis and thrombocytosis, \\ncontributes to a prothrombotic state. Atrial fibrillation, even in its \\nparoxysmal form, is a well-established risk factor for systemic embolism. When \\nthese conditions coexist, thromboembolic risk is significantly elevated, \\ncreating complex management challenges due to concurrent bleeding risks. We \\npresent a 76-year-old woman with T315I BCR-ABL1 chronic-phase CML, paroxysmal \\natrial fibrillation, and hypertension who presented with acute left upper \\nquadrant abdominal pain. Imaging studies confirmed splenic infarction. \\nLaboratory findings revealed marked leukocytosis and thrombocytosis. She was \\ntreated with intravenous fluids, analgesia, and anticoagulation; initially with \\nheparin infusion, later transitioned to apixaban. Concurrently, disease-directed \\ntherapy with asciminib and hydroxyurea led to a partial hematologic response. At \\nthree-month follow-up, she remained free of recurrent thrombosis, bleeding, or \\nabdominal symptoms. This case highlights the multifactorial etiology of splenic \\ninfarction in patients with overlapping hematologic and cardiovascular risk \\nfactors. It underscores the importance of timely imaging for diagnosis and the \\ndelicate balance of anticoagulation in the setting of malignancy-associated \\nthrombocytosis. Individualized, multidisciplinary management and careful \\nlong-term follow-up are essential to optimize outcomes in this complex patient \\npopulation.\\n\\nCopyright © 2025, Annan et al.\\n\\nDOI: 10.7759/cureus.88032\\nPMCID: PMC12263458\\nPMID: 40673287\\n\\nConflict of interest statement: Human subjects: Informed consent for treatment \\nand open access publication was obtained or waived by all participants in this \\nstudy.

Ninety-day complications, \\ninpatient resources, repeat hospitalizations, and functional outcomes were \\nmeasured for COVID-19 patients and age- and sex-matched controls. The sample \\nsize was determined based on a priori power analysis. Statistics consisted of 2 \\nsample t-tests or Fisher's exact test based on variable type with α = 0.01 to \\ncorrect for multiple comparisons.\\nRESULTS: Of 1914 TKA and 1424 THA patients, 20 and 28 with asymptomatic COVID-19 \\nwere compared to 75 and 105 controls, respectively. While there was no \\nstatistically significant increase in relative risk for major (TKA P = .04|THA P \\n= .12) or thromboembolic (TKA P = .21|THA P = .04) complications, the COVID-19 \\ngroup experienced mortality, ischemic stroke, pulmonary embolism, and deep vein \\nthrombosis. There was no significant difference in admission length (TKA P = \\n.29|THA P = .22), physical therapy (TKA P = .36|THA P = .36), labs (TKA P = \\n.57|THA P = .82), nonhome discharge (TKA P = 1|THA P = 1), or mobility (TKA P = \\n.18|THA P = .21).\\nCONCLUSIONS: The current study suggests that, while perioperative risk of \\nasymptomatic COVID-19 does not meet the threshold for statistical significance, \\narthroplasty surgeons should be aware of potential mortality and morbidity and \\nengage in shared decision-making regarding deferral of surgery, especially for \\npatients with other comorbidities.\\n\\n© 2025 The Authors.\\n\\nDOI: 10.1016/j.artd.2025.101745\\nPMCID: PMC12269793\\nPMID: 40678785\"}"
