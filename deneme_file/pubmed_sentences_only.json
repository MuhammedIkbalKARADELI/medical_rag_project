  "METHOD: Patients were prospectively selected from a pool of 2,789 consecutive \ntype 2 DM patients.",
  "After exclusions, 174 patients formed the monotherapy group, \nand 143 age- and sex-matched patients who were switched to SGLT2 inhibitor \ncombination therapy constituted the combination therapy group.",

  "RESULTS: Although there was no statistically significant difference between the \nmonotherapy and combination therapy groups in terms of baseline ECG parameters, \nQT (385.05 +- 13.21 vs. 372.32 +- 4.32; P < 0.001), QTc (409.24 +- 8.17 vs. \n383.72 +- 7.24; P < 0.001), ICEB (4.15 +- 0.51 vs. 4.03 +- 0.54; P = 0.004), and \nICEBc (4.40 +- 0.75 vs. 4.16 +- 0.61; P < 0.0001) values at the six-month mark \nwere significantly lower in the SGLT2 inhibitor group.",
